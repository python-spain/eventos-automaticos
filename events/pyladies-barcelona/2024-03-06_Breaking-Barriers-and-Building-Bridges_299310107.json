Its purpose was to provide a safe space for queer people around the globe to share experiences anonymously, and link them to a physical space. The information of the page arises this question: How does race, gender, sexuality, citizenship, ability, and class affect the ways in which we relate to, move through, and create space?\nThis presentation aims to give some insights in the process of answering this question, respecting the anonymity of the community involved, through the analysis of the discourse of the shared experiences and its relationship with the physical space defined by each country.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\u27a1\ufe0f Location\n[Adevinta Spain](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=41.403122%2C%202.192204)\nC/ de la Ciutat de Granada, 150 \u00b7 Barcelona, CT\nAdevinta Auditorium (ask at the registration desk)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Access Control (IMPORTANT!)\n\n* \ud83d\udec2 The security access control requires an **attendee list** (full name) and a **means of identification** (DNI, NIE, passport) otherwise you will be removed from the list.\n* \u2060Please remember our attendance policy: https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-BCN/messages/81834174/.\n\nIn short:\n\n* If you are a man with a non-male friend attending the meetup: join the meetup and indicate which PyLady invited you\n* \u2060If you do not have any friend who can add you as their +1, don\u2019t worry!
