  "description": "This month we have two awesome talks about the trip from being a **Data Science bootcamp student** to a **Freelancer**, and about how to **Collaborate in a team between Data Scientists and Data Engineers**.\n\n***\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** From Data Science Bootcamp student to Freelancer\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: Nikita Polovinkin ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/npolovinkin/))\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: \\~30min\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: Sharing valuable experience of attending a Data Science Bootcamp and applying the skills acquired to start a career in the tech sector as a Data Scientist freelancer, working for companies from different sectors, providing valuable insights in their business and provide automation\n\n***\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** Collaboration between Data Scientists and Data Engineers - Raise team's performance through Merge Requests\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: Josep Mart\u00ednez ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josepmartinezvila/)) & Juan Prida ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-prida/))\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: \\~40min\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: Sometimes Data Scientists that are not computer engineers and come from different backgrounds, write Machine Learning models and to deploy them to production Data Engineers have to do some refactoring. In this talk we will see how we can improve the workflow and have Data Scientists writing production code through Merge Requests.\n\n***\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Only register if you can attend!\n\n* This is a reduced capacity event.
