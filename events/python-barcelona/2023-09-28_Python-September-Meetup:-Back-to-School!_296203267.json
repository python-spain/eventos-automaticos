  "description": "This month we have two awesome talks about making **numerical computations run fast** and **using GenAI in Fashion Design**.\n\n***\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** The two language problem in vectorized python expressions\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: David Buchaca ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-buchaca-74a8a110a/))\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: \\~30min\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: There is a bit of a misleading conception that in order to make python code fast the best approach is to handle code in vectorized expressions. While this can be true in some cases, especially when your code can be mapped to an exact function call of numpy/scipy it is a dangerous path if followed without critical thinking. Algorithms can increase the complexity when vectorizing code. This can happen without the user being aware of it, since vectorized code is using other libraries. In this talk we will iterate over examples on how to think about devectorized expressions using cython and discuss the two language problem that arises in such a setting.\n\n***\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** AI image generative algorithm in fashion design\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: Lucas Pastur ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-pastur-romay/))\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: \\~45min\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: This presentation will explore the application of image generative algorithms in fashion design with a particular focus on their most valuable use cases and implementation at Mango. We will discuss the innovative ways in which these algorithms are transforming the fashion industry by generating diverse design elements such as photographic prints, vector and cartoon illustrations, fabric patterns, and textures. Additionally, we will delve into the art of prompt engineering, providing valuable insights into the creative process behind generating useful images. The presentation will shed light on the future of fashion design and the growing influence of artificial intelligence in this dynamic industry.\n\n***\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Only register if you can attend!\n\n* This is a reduced capacity event. Only register if you plan on attending, and if something comes up please free your spot so somebody else can pick it up!\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Location\n\n* Aula B3, Facultat de Matem\u00e0tiques i Inform\u00e0tica, Universitat de Barcelona, Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes 585, 08007 Barcelona.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Access Control\n\n* \ud83d\udec2 The security access control requires an attendee list and a **means of identification**.
