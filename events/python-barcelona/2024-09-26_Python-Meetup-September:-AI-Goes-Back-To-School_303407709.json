  "description": "For the month of September, we have two amazing talks about **LLMs** and **RAGs**.\n\\-\\-\\-\nSchedule:\n\n* \ud83d\udc4b & \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f 18:30: Welcome and Talks\n* \ud83c\udf55 **&** \ud83c\udf7b 20:00: Networking, food and drinks!\n* \ud83d\udc4b 21:00: Bye!\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** *From text to actions: LLMs as the new software consumers*\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: Pol Alvarez Vecino\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: 30 minutes\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: QA bots, copilots, workflow automation - LLMs are evolving to control our software through natural language. The endgame is APIs. LLMs that can convert user intents directly into HTTP requests, like Talk2Apis does today, will have the flexibility to access any service. This creates a machine-first software economy with big implications for developers. Python examples included.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n* \u27a1\ufe0f **What:** *Ragtime: An Approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation*\n* \ud83d\udce2 **Who**: Javier Martinez Alcantara\n* \u23f1 **Duration**: 30 minutes\n* \ud83d\udc45 **Language**: English\n* \ud83e\uddd0 **Abstract**: In this session, we'll explore a pattern that has sparked significant interest in the world of natural language models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We'll walk through a practical implementation, dive into its details, and share insights based on our experiences working with these methods. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, we encourage you to join\u2014what matters most is your interest in LLMs, machine learning, and engineering, and how to leverage these technologies to bring value to your company or organization.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\u27a1\ufe0f Location:\nCodurance Offices Barcelona:\n[Carrer de Pallars 99, 4th floor, room 41, Barcelona, 08018](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z7eb1XyPJZYfLM3h8)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\u27a1\ufe0f Access Control\n\n* \ud83d\udec2 The security access control requires an **attendee list** (full name) and a **means of identification** (DNI, NIE, passport)\n* \u26a0\ufe0f Make sure you register for the event with your **full name** and **ID**.
